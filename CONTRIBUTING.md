# Contributing to Velox

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Velox**! Before you begin
writing code, it is important that you share your intention to contribute with
the team, based on the type of contribution:

1. You want to propose a new feature and implement it:
  * Post about your intended feature in an issue, and we shall discuss the
    design and implementation. Once we agree that the plan looks good, go ahead
    and implement it.
2. You want to implement a feature or bug-fix for an outstanding issue.
  * Search for your issue in [the Velox issue list.](https://github.com/facebookincubator/velox/issues)
  * Pick an issue and comment that you'd like to work on the feature or
    bug-fix.
  * If you need more context on a particular issue, please ask and we shall
    provide.

The main communication channel with the Velox community is [the Velox-OSS Slack
workspace](http://velox-oss.slack.com). Please don't hesitate in reaching out.
While doing so, in order to ensure that all contributions are timely reviewed,
we recommend authors to start a discussion with the team and make code review
arrangements.

Once you implement and test your feature or bug-fix, please submit a Pull
Request to <https://github.com/facebookincubator/velox>, tagging the reviewers
you previously identified.

We also encourage authors to proactively communicate during code review; please
provide an ETA on when review comments will be addressed (if applicable), and
explicitly notify reviewers when the PR is ready for another round of reviews.
