# Contributing

Welcome! Thank you for your interest in the Velox project. Before starting to
contribute, please take a moment to review the guidelines outlined below.

Contributions are not just about code. Contributing code is great, but that’s
probably not the best place to start. There are many ways in which people can 
make contributions to the project and community.

## Code of Conduct

First and foremost, the Velox project and all its contributors and maintainers
are governed by a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). When participating,
you are expected to uphold this code.

## Community

A good first step to getting involved in the Velox project is to participate in
conversations in GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/facebookincubator/velox/issues) 
and [Discussions](https://github.com/facebookincubator/velox/discussions), and join the
[the Velox-OSS Slack workspace](http://velox-oss.slack.com) - please reach out to 
**velox@meta.com** to get access.

## Documentation

Help the community understand how to use the Velox library by proposing
additions to our [docs](https://facebookincubator.github.io/velox/index.html) or pointing 
out outdated or missing pieces.

## Bug Reports

Found a bug? Help us by filing an issue on GitHub.

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching 
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/facebookincubator/velox/issues). If you're
unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to
include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as
possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the
expected behavior.

Meta has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe disclosure 
of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process outlined on that page 
and do not file a public issue.

## Code Contribution Process

The code contribution process is designed to reduce the burden on reviewers and 
maintainers, allowing them to provide more timely feedback and keeping the 
amount of rework from contributors to a minimum.

We encourage new contributors to start with bug fixes and small features so you
get familiar with the contributing process, while building relationships with
community members.
Look for GitHub issues labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/facebookincubator/velox/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or consider adding one of the
[missing Presto SQL functions](https://github.com/facebookincubator/velox/issues/2262).

The contribution process is outlined below:

1. Sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://code.facebook.com/cla)
   (CLA). This step needs to be completed only once.

2. Review the [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) file. By contributing to Velox, you agree that your
   contributions will be licensed under that LICENSE file. This step needs to be
   completed only once.

3. Start a discussion by creating a Github Issue, or asking on Slack (unless the change is trivial).
   * This step helps you identify possible collaborators and reviewers.
   * Does the proposed change align with technical vision and project values?
   * Will the change conflict with another change in progress? If so, work with others to minimize impact.

4. Implement the change.
   * Always follow the coding best practices outlined in the list below.
   * If the change is large, consider posting a draft Github pull request (PR)
     with the title prefixed with [WIP], and share with collaborators to get early feedback.
   * Give the PR a clear, brief description; when the PR is
   merged, this will be retained in the extended commit message. Check out 
   [How to Write Better Git Commit Messages – A Step-By-Step Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/)
   and [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) to
   learn more about how to write good commit messages.
   * Make sure the PR passes all CI tests.
   * Create/submit a Github PR and tag the reviewers identified in Step 3.

5. Review is performed by one or more reviewers.
   * This normally happens within a few days, but may take longer if the change is
   large, complex, or if a critical reviewer is unavailable (feel free to ping in the
   PR).

6. Address feedback and update the PR.
   * After pushing changes, add a comment to the PR mentioning the
   reviewer(s) by name, stating the comments have been addressed. This is the best
   way to ensure that the reviewer is notified that the code is ready to be reviewed
   again.
   * As a PR author, please do not "Resolve Conversation" when review comments are 
   addressed. Instead, wait for the reviewer to verify the comment has been
   addressed and resolve the conversation.

7. Iterate on this process until your changes are reviewed and accepted by a 
   maintainer. At this point, a Meta employee will be required to merge your PR,
   due to tooling limitations.

## Coding Best Practices

When submitting code contributions to Velox, make sure to adhere to the
following best practices:

1. **Coding Style**: Review and strictly follow our coding style document, 
   available in [`CODING_STYLE.md`](CODING_STYLE.md).
   * Velox favors consistency over personal preference. If there are 
   technical reasons why a specific guideline should not be followed, 
   please start a separate discussion with the community to update the
   coding style document first.
   * If you are simply updating code that did not comply with the coding 
   style, please do so in a standalone PR isolated from other logic changes. 

2. **Small Incremental Changes**: If the change is large, work with the maintainers
   on a plan to break and submit it as smaller (yet atomic) parts.
   * [Research indicates](https://smartbear.com/learn/code-review/best-practices-for-peer-code-review/) 
   that engineers can only effectively review up to 
   400 lines of code at a time. The human brain can only process so much information 
   at a time; beyond that threshold the ability to find bugs and other flaws
   decreases.
   * As larger PRs usually take longer to review and iterate, they 
   tend to slow down the software development process. As much as possible, 
   split your work into smaller changes. 

3. **Unit tests**: With rare exceptions, every PR should contain unit tests
   covering the logic added/modified.
   * Unit tests protect our codebase from regressions, promote less coupled
   APIs, and provide an executable form of documentation that’s useful for
   new engineers reasoning about the codebase.
   * Good unit tests are fast, isolated, repeatable, and exercise all APIs 
   including their edge cases.
   * The lack of existing tests is not a good reason not to add tests to
   your PR. If a component or API does not have a corresponding 
   unit test suite, please consider improving the codebase by first adding a
   new unit test suite to ensure the existing behavior is correct.

4. **Code Comments**: Appropriately add comments to your code and document APIs.
   * As a library, Velox code is optimized for the reader, not the writer.
   * Comments should capture information that was on the writer’s mind, but
   could not be represented as code. The overall goal is to make the code more
   obvious and remove obscurity.
   * As a guideline, every file, class, member variable, and member function
   that is not a getter/setter should be documented.
   * As much as possible, try to avoid functions with very large bodies. In the 
   (rare) cases where large code blocks are needed, a good practice is to group 
   smaller blocks of related code, and precede them with a blank line and a 
   high-level comment explaining what the block does.

5. **Benchmarks**: Add micro-benchmarks to support your claims.
   * As needed, add micro-benchmark to objectively evaluate performance and
   efficiency trade-offs.

6. **APIs**: Carefully design APIs.
   * As a library, Velox APIs should be intentional. External API should only 
   be deliberately created. 
   * As a rule of thumb, components should be deep and encapsulate as much
   complexity as possible, and APIs should be narrow, minimizing dependencies
   across components and preventing implementation details from leaking through
   the API.

## Adding Scalar Functions

Adding Presto and Spark functions are a good way to get yourself familiar with
Velox and the code review process. In addition to the general contribution
guidelines presented above, here are specific guidelines for contributing
functions:

1. Read [How to add a scalar function?](https://facebookincubator.github.io/velox/develop/scalar-functions.html) guide.

2. Use the following template for the PR title: Add xxx [Presto|Spark] function (replace xxx with the function name).
   * Ensure the PR description contains a link to the function documentation
   from Presto or Spark docs. 
   * Describe the function semantics and edge cases clearly.

3. Use Presto or Spark to check the function semantics. 
   * Try different edge cases to check whether the function returns null, or
   throws, etc. 
   * Make sure to replicate the exact semantics.

4. Add tests exercising common inputs, all possible signatures and corner cases. 
   * Make sure the test cases are concise and easily readable. 

5. Make sure that obvious inefficiencies are addressed. 
   * If appropriate, provide micro-benchmarks to support your claims with data. 

4. Add documentation for the new function to an .rst file under velox/docs/functions directory.
   * Functions in documentation are listed in alphabetical order. Make sure to
   place the new function so that the order is preserved.

6. Run [Fuzzer](https://facebookincubator.github.io/velox/develop/testing/fuzzer.html)
   to test new the function in isolation as well as in combination with other functions.
   Note: Fuzzer is under active development and the commands below may not work as is.
   Consult the CircleCI configuration in .circleci/config.yml for the up-to-date command
   line arguments.

   ```
   # Test the new function in isolation. Use --only flag to restrict the set of functions
   # and run for 60 seconds or longer.
   velox_expression_fuzzer_test --only <my-new-function-name> --duration_sec 60 --logtostderr=1 --enable_variadic_signatures --velox_fuzzer_enable_complex_types --lazy_vector_generation_ratio 0.2 --velox_fuzzer_enable_column_reuse --velox_fuzzer_enable_expression_reuse

   # Test the new function in combination with other functions. Do not restrict the set
   # of functions and run for 10 minutes (600 seconds) or longer.
   velox_expression_fuzzer_test --duration_sec 600 --logtostderr=1 --enable_variadic_signatures --velox_fuzzer_enable_complex_types --lazy_vector_generation_ratio 0.2 --velox_fuzzer_enable_column_reuse --velox_fuzzer_enable_expression_reuse
   ```
