<h1>Runtime Metrics<a class="headerlink" href="#runtime-metrics" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Runtime metrics are used to collect the metrics of important velox runtime events
for monitoring purpose. The collected metrics can provide insights into the
continuous availability and performance analysis of a Velox runtime system. For
instance, the collected data can help automatically generate alerts at an
outage. Velox provides a framework to collect the metrics which consists of
three steps:</p>
<p><strong>Define</strong>: define the name and type for the metric through DEFINE_METRIC,
DEFINE_HISTOGRAM_METRIC, DEFINE_QUANTILE_STAT, and DEFINE_DYNAMIC_QUANTILE_STAT
macros. DEFINE_HISTOGRAM_METRIC is used for histogram metric type,
DEFINE_QUANTILE_STAT for quantile metrics, DEFINE_DYNAMIC_QUANTILE_STAT for
dynamic quantile metrics, and DEFINE_METRIC is used for the other types (see
metric type definition below). BaseStatsReporter provides methods for metric
definition. Register metrics during startup using registerVeloxMetrics() API.</p>
<p><strong>Record</strong>: record the metric data point using RECORD_METRIC_VALUE,
RECORD_HISTOGRAM_METRIC_VALUE, RECORD_QUANTILE_STAT_VALUE, and
RECORD_DYNAMIC_QUANTILE_STAT_VALUE macros when the corresponding event happens.
BaseStatsReporter provides methods for metric recording.</p>
<p><strong>Export</strong>: aggregates the collected data points based on the defined metrics,
and periodically exports to the backend monitoring service, such as ODS used by
Meta, Apache projects <a class="reference external" href="https://opencensus.io/">OpenCensus</a>  and <a class="reference external" href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> provided by OSS. A derived
implementation of BaseStatsReporter is required to integrate with a specific
monitoring service. The metric aggregation granularity and export interval are
also configured based on the actual used monitoring service.</p>
<p>Velox supports seven metric types:</p>
<p><strong>Count</strong>: tracks the count of events, such as the number of query failures.</p>
<p><strong>Sum</strong>: tracks the sum of event data point values, such as sum of query scan
read bytes.</p>
<p><strong>Avg</strong>: tracks the average of event data point values, such as average of query
execution time.</p>
<p><strong>Rate</strong>: tracks the sum of event data point values per second, such as the
number of shuffle requests per second.</p>
<p><strong>Histogram</strong>: tracks the distribution of event data point values, such as query
execution time distribution. The histogram metric divides the entire data range
into a series of adjacent equal-sized intervals or buckets, and then count how
many data values fall into each bucket. DEFINE_HISTOGRAM_METRIC specifies the data
range by min/max values, and the number of buckets. Any collected data value
less than min is counted in min bucket, and any one larger than max is counted
in max bucket. It also allows to specify the value percentiles to report for
monitoring. This allows BaseStatsReporter and the backend monitoring service to
optimize the aggregated data storage.</p>
<p><strong>Quantile</strong>: tracks quantile statistics (percentiles) of event data point values
over configurable sliding time windows, such as P50, P95, and P99 latencies over
the last 60 seconds. Unlike histograms which use fixed buckets, quantile metrics
dynamically calculate percentiles from the actual data distribution.
DEFINE_QUANTILE_STAT specifies the stat types to export (e.g., AVG, COUNT, SUM),
the percentiles to track (as values between 0.0 and 1.0), and the sliding window
periods in seconds. This provides more accurate percentile calculations compared
to histogram approximations, especially for metrics with varying distributions.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Quantile</strong>: extends quantile metrics to support dynamic key patterns
with runtime substitution using format placeholders (e.g., “latency.{}.{}” where
placeholders are replaced with actual values like database names or endpoint names).
DEFINE_DYNAMIC_QUANTILE_STAT registers a pattern template, and
RECORD_DYNAMIC_QUANTILE_STAT_VALUE substitutes the placeholders to create specific
metric instances. This enables efficient tracking of quantile metrics across
multiple dimensions without pre-registering every possible combination.</p>
