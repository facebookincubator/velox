/// TPC-H scale factor, the maximum batch size, and the offset. The common usage
/// is to make successive calls to this API advancing the offset parameter,
/// until all records were read. Clients might also assign different slices of
/// the range "[0, getRowCount(Table, scaleFactor)[" to different threads in
/// order to generate datasets in parallel.
///
/// If not enough records are available given a particular scale factor and
/// offset, less than maxRows records might be returned.
///
/// Data is always returned in a RowVector.
