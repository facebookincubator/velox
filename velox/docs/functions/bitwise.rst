    Returns the bitwise AND of ``x`` and ``y`` in 2's complement representation.

.. function:: bitwise_not(x) -> [same as x]

    Returns the bitwise NOT of ``x`` in 2's complement representation.

.. function:: bitwise_or(x, y) -> [same as x]

    Returns the bitwise OR of ``x`` and ``y`` in 2's complement representation.
