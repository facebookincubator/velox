String Functions
====================================

.. note::

    These functions assume that the input strings contain valid UTF-8 encoded
    Unicode code points. There are no explicit checks for valid UTF-8 and
    the functions may return incorrect results on invalid UTF-8.

    Additionally, the functions operate on Unicode code points and not user
    visible *characters* (or *grapheme clusters*).  Some languages combine
    multiple code points into a single user-perceived *character*, the basic
    unit of a writing system for a language, but the functions will treat each
    code point as a separate unit.

    The :func:`lower` and :func:`upper` functions do not perform
    locale-sensitive, context-sensitive, or one-to-many mappings required for
    some languages. Specifically, this will return incorrect results for
    Lithuanian, Turkish and Azeri.

.. function:: chr(n) -> varchar

    Returns the Unicode code point ``n`` as a single character string.

.. function:: codepoint(string) -> integer

    Returns the Unicode code point of the only character of ``string``.

.. function:: concat(string1, ..., stringN) -> varchar

    Returns the concatenation of ``string1``, ``string2``, ``...``, ``stringN``.
    This function provides the same functionality as the
    SQL-standard concatenation operator (``||``).

.. function:: from_utf8(binary) -> varchar

    Decodes a UTF-8 encoded string from ``binary``. Invalid UTF-8 sequences
    are replaced with the Unicode replacement character ``U+FFFD``.

.. function:: from_utf8(binary, replace) -> varchar

    Decodes a UTF-8 encoded string from ``binary``. Invalid UTF-8 sequences are
    replaced with `replace`. The `replace` argument can be either Unicode code
    point (bigint), a single character or empty string. When `replace` is an
    empty string invalid characters are removed.

.. function:: length(string) -> bigint

    Returns the length of ``string`` in characters.

.. function:: lower(string) -> varchar

    Converts ``string`` to lowercase.

.. function:: lpad(string, size, padstring) -> varchar

     Left pads ``string`` to ``size`` characters with ``padstring``. If
     ``size`` is less than the length of ``string``, the result is truncated
     to ``size`` characters. ``size`` must not be negative and ``padstring``
     must be non-empty.

.. function:: ltrim(string) -> varchar

    Removes leading whitespace from string.

.. function:: replace(string, search) -> varchar

    Removes all instances of ``search`` from ``string``.

.. function:: replace(string, search, replace) -> varchar

    Replaces all instances of ``search`` with ``replace`` in ``string``.

    If ``search`` is an empty string, inserts ``replace`` in front of every
    character and at the end of the ``string``.

.. function:: reverse(string) -> varchar

    Reverses ``string``.

.. function:: rpad(string, size, padstring) -> varchar

     Right pads ``string`` to ``size`` characters with ``padstring``. If
     ``size`` is less than the length of ``string``, the result is truncated
     to ``size`` characters. ``size`` must not be negative and ``padstring``
     must be non-empty.

.. function:: rtrim(string) -> varchar

    Removes trailing whitespace from string.

.. function:: split(string, delimiter) -> array(string)

    Splits ``string`` on ``delimiter`` and returns an array.

.. function:: split(string, delimiter, limit) -> array(string)

    Splits ``string`` on ``delimiter`` and returns an array of size at most ``limit``.

    The last element in the array always contains everything left in the string.
    ``limit`` must be a positive number.

.. function:: split_part(string, delimiter, index) -> string

    Splits ``string`` on ``delimiter`` and returns the part at index ``index``.

    Field indexes start with 1. If the index is larger than the number of fields,
    then null is returned.

.. function:: strpos(string, substring) -> bigint

    Returns the starting position of the first instance of ``substring`` in
    ``string``. Positions start with ``1``. If not found, ``0`` is returned.

.. function:: strpos(string, substring, instance) -> bigint

    Returns the position of the N-th ``instance`` of ``substring`` in ``string``.
    ``instance`` must be a positive number.
    Positions start with ``1``. If not found, ``0`` is returned.

.. function:: strrpos(string, substring) -> bigint

    Returns the starting position of the last instance of ``substring`` in
    ``string``. Positions start with ``1``. If not found, ``0`` is returned.

.. function:: strrpos(string, substring, instance) -> bigint

    Returns the position of the N-th ``instance`` of ``substring`` in ``string`` starting from the end of the string.
    ``instance`` must be a positive number.
    Positions start with ``1``. If not found, ``0`` is returned.

.. function:: substr(string, start) -> varchar

    Returns the rest of ``string`` from the starting position ``start``.
    Positions start with ``1``. A negative starting position is interpreted
    as being relative to the end of the string.

.. function:: substr(string, start, length) -> varchar

    Returns a substring from ``string`` of length ``length`` from the starting
    position ``start``. Positions start with ``1``. A negative starting
    position is interpreted as being relative to the end of the string.

.. function:: trim(string) -> varchar

    Removes starting and ending whitespaces from ``string``.

.. function:: upper(string) -> varchar

    Converts ``string`` to uppercase.

Unicode Functions
-----------------

.. function:: to_utf8(string) -> varbinary

    Encodes ``string`` into a UTF-8 varbinary representation.
