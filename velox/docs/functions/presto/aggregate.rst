Aggregate Functions
===================

Aggregate functions operate on a set of values to compute a single result.

Except for :func:`count`, :func:`count_if`, :func:`max_by`, :func:`min_by` and
:func:`approx_distinct`, all of these aggregate functions ignore null values
and return null for no input rows or when all values are null. For example,
:func:`sum` returns null rather than zero and :func:`avg` does not include null
values in the count. The ``coalesce`` function can be used to convert null into
zero.

Some aggregate functions such as :func:`array_agg` produce different results
depending on the order of input values.

General Aggregate Functions
---------------------------

.. function:: arbitrary(x) -> [same as x]

    Returns an arbitrary non-null value of ``x``, if one exists.

.. function:: any_value(x) -> [same as x]

    This is an alias for :func:`arbitrary`.

.. function:: array_agg(x) -> array<[same as x]>

    Returns an array created from the input ``x`` elements. Ignores null
    inputs if :doc:`presto.array_agg.ignore_nulls <../../configs>` is set
    to false.

.. function:: avg(x) -> double|real

    Returns the average (arithmetic mean) of all non-null input values.
    When x is of type REAL, the result type is REAL.
    For all other input types, the result type is DOUBLE.

.. function:: bool_and(boolean) -> boolean

    Returns ``TRUE`` if every input value is ``TRUE``, otherwise ``FALSE``.

.. function:: bool_or(boolean) -> boolean

    Returns ``TRUE`` if any input value is ``TRUE``, otherwise ``FALSE``.

.. function:: checksum(x) -> varbinary

    Returns an order-insensitive checksum of the given values.

.. function:: count(*) -> bigint

    Returns the number of input rows.

.. function:: count(x) -> bigint
    :noindex:

    Returns the number of non-null input values.

.. function:: count_if(x) -> bigint

    Returns the number of ``TRUE`` input values.
    This function is equivalent to ``count(CASE WHEN x THEN 1 END)``.

.. function:: entropy(c) -> double

    Returns the log-2 entropy of count input-values.

    .. math::

        \mathrm{entropy}(c) = \sum_i \left[ {c_i \over \sum_j [c_j]} \log_2\left({\sum_j [c_j] \over c_i}\right) \right].

    ``c`` must be a ``integer`` column of non-negative values.

    The function ignores any ``NULL`` count. If the sum of non-``NULL`` counts is 0,
    it returns 0.

.. function:: every(boolean) -> boolean

    This is an alias for :func:`bool_and`.

.. function:: histogram(x)

    Returns a map containing the count of the number of times
    each input value occurs. Supports integral, floating-point,
    boolean, timestamp, and date input types.

.. function:: geometric_mean(bigint) -> double
              geometric_mean(double) -> double
              geometric_mean(real) -> real

    Returns the `geometric mean <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean>`_ of all input values.

.. function:: max_by(x, y) -> [same as x]

    Returns the value of ``x`` associated with the maximum value of ``y`` over all input values.
    ``y`` must be an orderable type.

.. function:: max_by(x, y, n) -> array([same as x])
    :noindex:

    Returns n values of ``x`` associated with the n largest values of ``y`` in descending order of ``y``.

.. function:: min_by(x, y) -> [same as x]

    Returns the value of ``x`` associated with the minimum value of ``y`` over all input values.
    ``y`` must be an orderable type.

.. function:: min_by(x, y, n) -> array([same as x])
    :noindex:

    Returns n values of ``x`` associated with the n smallest values of ``y`` in ascending order of ``y``.

.. function:: max(x) -> [same as x]

    Returns the maximum value of all input values.
    ``x`` must not contain nulls when it is complex type.
    ``x`` must be an orderable type.
    Nulls are ignored if there are any non-null inputs.
    For REAL and DOUBLE types, NaN is considered greater than Infinity.

.. function:: max(x, n) -> array<[same as x]>
    :noindex:

    Returns ``n`` largest values of all input values of ``x``.
    ``n`` must be a positive integer and not exceed 10'000.
    Currently not supported for ARRAY, MAP, and ROW input types.
    Nulls are not included in the output array.
    For REAL and DOUBLE types, NaN is considered greater than Infinity.

.. function:: min(x) -> [same as x]

    Returns the minimum value of all input values.
    ``x`` must not contain nulls when it is complex type.
    ``x`` must be an orderable type.
    Nulls are ignored if there are any non-null inputs.
    For REAL and DOUBLE types, NaN is considered greater than Infinity.

.. function:: min(x, n) -> array<[same as x]>
    :noindex:

    Returns ``n`` smallest values of all input values of ``x``.
    ``n`` must be a positive integer and not exceed 10'000.
    Currently not supported for ARRAY, MAP, and ROW input types.
    Nulls are not included in output array.
    For REAL and DOUBLE types, NaN is considered greater than Infinity.

.. function:: multimap_agg(K key, V value) -> map(K,array(V))

    Returns a multimap created from the input ``key`` / ``value`` pairs.
    Each key can be associated with multiple values.

.. function:: reduce_agg(inputValue T, initialState S, inputFunction(S,T,S), combineFunction(S,S,S)) -> S

    Reduces all non-NULL input values into a single value. ``inputFunction``
    will be invoked for each non-NULL input value. If all inputs are NULL, the
    result is NULL. In addition to taking the input value, ``inputFunction``
    takes the current state, initially ``initialState``, and returns the new state.
    ``combineFunction`` will be invoked to combine two states into a new state.
    The final state is returned. Throws an error if ``initialState`` is NULL or
    ``inputFunction`` or ``combineFunction`` returns a NULL.

    Take care when designing ``initialState``, ``inputFunction`` and ``combineFunction``.
    These need to support evaluating aggregation in a distributed manner using partial
    aggregation on many nodes, followed by shuffle over group-by keys, followed by
    final aggregation. Given a set of all possible values of state, make sure that
    combineFunction is `commutative <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property>`_
    and `associative <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property>`_
    operation with initialState as the
    `identity <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_element>`_ value.

     combineFunction(s, initialState) = s for any s

     combineFunction(s1, s2) = combineFunction(s2, s1) for any s1 and s2

     combineFunction(s1, combineFunction(s2, s3)) = combineFunction(combineFunction(s1, s2), s3) for any s1, s2, s3

    In addition, make sure that the following holds for the inputFunction:

     inputFunction(inputFunction(initialState, x), y) = combineFunction(inputFunction(initialState, x), inputFunction(initialState, y)) for any x and y

    Note that reduce_agg doesn't support evaluation over sorted inputs.::

                ARRAY[2, 3, 4]
        ) AS t(elements);

    Returns ARRAY[1, 2, 3, 4]

.. function:: sum(x) -> [same as x]

    Returns the sum of all input values.

Bitwise Aggregate Functions
---------------------------

    Returns the bitwise AND of all input values in 2's complement representation.

    Supported types are TINYINT, SMALLINT, INTEGER and BIGINT.

.. function:: bitwise_or_agg(x) -> [same as x]

    Returns the bitwise OR of all input values in 2's complement representation.

    Supported types are TINYINT, SMALLINT, INTEGER and BIGINT.

.. function:: bitwise_xor_agg(x) -> [same as x]

    Returns the bitwise XOR of all input values in 2's complement representation.

    Supported types are TINYINT, SMALLINT, INTEGER and BIGINT.

Map Aggregate Functions
-----------------------

.. function:: map_agg(K key, V value) -> map(K,V)

    Returns a map created from the input ``key`` / ``value`` pairs. Inputs with NULL or duplicate keys are ignored.

.. function:: map_union(map(K,V)) -> map(K,V)

    Returns the union of all the input ``maps``.
    If a ``key`` is found in multiple input ``maps``,
    that ``key’s`` ``value`` in the resulting ``map`` comes from an arbitrary input ``map``.

.. function:: map_union_sum(map(K,V)) -> map(K,V)

    Returns the union of all the input maps summing the values of matching keys in all
    the maps. All null values in the original maps are coalesced to 0.

Approximate Aggregate Functions
-------------------------------

.. function:: approx_distinct(x) -> bigint

    Returns the approximate number of distinct input values.
    This function provides an approximation of ``count(DISTINCT x)``.
    Zero is returned if all input values are null.

    This function should produce a standard error of 2.3%, which is the
    standard deviation of the (approximately normal) error distribution over
    all possible sets. It does not guarantee an upper bound on the error for
    any specific input set.

.. function:: approx_distinct(x, e) -> bigint
   :noindex:

    Returns the approximate number of distinct input values.
    This function provides an approximation of ``count(DISTINCT x)``.
    Zero is returned if all input values are null.

    This function should produce a standard error of no more than ``e``, which
    is the standard deviation of the (approximately normal) error distribution
    over all possible sets. It does not guarantee an upper bound on the error
    for any specific input set. The current implementation of this function
    requires that ``e`` be in the range of ``[0.0040625, 0.26000]``.

.. function:: approx_most_frequent(buckets, value, capacity) -> map<[same as value], bigint>

    Computes the top frequent values up to ``buckets`` elements approximately.
    Approximate estimation of the function enables us to pick up the frequent
    values with less memory.  Larger ``capacity`` improves the accuracy of
    underlying algorithm with sacrificing the memory capacity.  The returned
    value is a map containing the top elements with corresponding estimated
    frequency.

    The error of the function depends on the permutation of the values and its
    cardinality.  We can set the capacity same as the cardinality of the
    underlying data to achieve the least error.

    ``buckets`` and ``capacity`` must be ``bigint``.  ``value`` can be numeric
    or string type.

    The function uses the stream summary data structure proposed in the paper
    `Efficient computation of frequent and top-k elements in data streams`__
    by A. Metwally, D. Agrawal and A. Abbadi.

    in the array. The weight must be an integer value of at least one. It is
    effectively a replication count for the value ``x`` in the percentile
    set. Each element of the array must be between zero and one, and the array
    must be constant for all input rows.

.. function:: approx_percentile(x, w, percentages, accuracy) -> array<[same as x]>
   :noindex:
