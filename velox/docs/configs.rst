     - Description
   * - preferred_output_batch_bytes
     - integer
     - 10MB
     - Preferred size of batches in bytes to be returned by operators from Operator::getOutput. It is used when an
       estimate of average row size is known. Otherwise preferred_output_batch_rows is used.
   * - preferred_output_batch_rows
     - integer
     - 1024
     - Preferred number of rows to be returned by operators from Operator::getOutput. It is used when an estimate of

   * - table_scan_getoutput_time_limit_ms
     - integer
     - 5000
     - TableScan operator will exit getOutput() method after this many milliseconds even if it has no data to return yet. Zero means 'no time limit'.
   * - abandon_partial_aggregation_min_rows
     - integer
     - 100,000
     - Number of input rows to receive before starting to check whether to abandon partial aggregation.
   * - abandon_partial_aggregation_min_pct

     - integer
     - 80
     - Abandons partial TopNRowNumber if number of output rows equals or exceeds this percentage of the number of input rows.
   * - session_timezone
     - string
     -
     - User provided session timezone. Stores a string with the actual timezone name, e.g: "America/Los_Angeles".
   * - adjust_timestamp_to_session_timezone
     - bool
     - false
     - If true, timezone-less timestamp conversions (e.g. string to timestamp, when the string does not specify a timezone)
       will be adjusted to the user provided `session_timezone` (if any). For instance: if this option is true and user
       supplied "America/Los_Angeles", then "1970-01-01" will be converted to -28800 instead of 0. Similarly, timestamp
       to date conversions will adhere to user 'session_timezone', e.g: Timestamp(0) to Date will be -1 (number of days
       since epoch) for "America/Los_Angeles".
   * - track_operator_cpu_usage
     - bool
     - true
     - Whether to track CPU usage for stages of individual operators. Can be expensive when processing small batches,
       e.g. < 10K rows.
   * - hash_adaptivity_enabled
     - bool
     - true
     - If false, the 'group by' code is forced to use generic hash mode hashtable.
   * - adaptive_filter_reordering_enabled

     - Used for backpressure to block local exchange producers when the local exchange buffer reaches or exceeds this size.
   * - exchange.max_buffer_size
     - integer
     - 32MB
     - Size of buffer in the exchange client that holds data fetched from other nodes before it is processed.
       A larger buffer can increase network throughput for larger clusters and thus decrease query processing time
       at the expense of reducing the amount of memory available for other usage.
   * - merge_exchange.max_buffer_size
     - integer
     - 128MB
     - The aggregate buffer size (in bytes) across all exchange clients generated by the merge exchange operator,
       responsible for storing data retrieved from various nodes prior to processing. It is divided
       equally among all clients and has an upper and lower limit of 32MB and 1MB, respectively, per
       client. Enforced approximately, not strictly. A larger size can increase network throughput
       for larger clusters and thus decrease query processing time at the expense of reducing the
       amount of memory available for other usage.
   * - max_page_partitioning_buffer_size
     - integer
     - 32MB
     - The maximum size in bytes for the task's buffered output when output is partitioned using hash of partitioning keys. See PartitionedOutputNode::Kind::kPartitioned.

   * - max_output_buffer_size
     - integer
     - 32MB
     - The maximum size in bytes for the task's buffered output.

       The Drivers are resumed when the buffered size goes below OutputBufferManager::kContinuePct (90)% of this.
   * - min_table_rows_for_parallel_join_build
     - integer
     - 1000
     - The minimum number of table rows that can trigger the parallel hash join table build.
   * - debug.validate_output_from_operators
     - bool
     - false
     - If set to true, then during execution of tasks, the output vectors of every operator are validated for consistency.
       This is an expensive check so should only be used for debugging. It can help debug issues where malformed vector
       cause failures or crashes by helping identify which operator is generating them.
   * - enable_expression_evaluation_cache
     - bool
     - true
     - Whether to enable caches in expression evaluation. If set to true, optimizations including vector pools and
       evalWithMemo are enabled.
   * - max_shared_subexpr_results_cached
     - integer
     - 10
     - For a given shared subexpression, the maximum distinct sets of inputs we cache results for. Lambdas can call
       the same expression with different inputs many times, causing the results we cache to explode in size. Putting
       a limit contains the memory usage.
   * - driver_cpu_time_slice_limit_ms
     - integer
     - 0
     - If it is not zero, specifies the time limit that a driver can continuously
       run on a thread before yield. If it is zero, then it no limit.

Expression Evaluation Configuration
-----------------------------------
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 10 10 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property Name
     - Type
     - Default Value
     - Description
   * - expression.eval_simplified
     - boolean
     - false
     - Whether to use the simplified expression evaluation path.
   * - expression.track_cpu_usage
     - boolean
     - false
     - Whether to track CPU usage for individual expressions (supported by call and cast expressions). Can be expensive
       when processing small batches, e.g. < 10K rows.
   * - legacy_cast
     - bool
     - false
     - Enables legacy CAST semantics if set to true. CAST(timestamp AS varchar) uses 'T' as separator between date and
       time (instead of a space), and the year part is not padded.
   * - cast_match_struct_by_name
     - bool
     - false
     - This flag makes the Row conversion to by applied in a way that the casting row field are matched by name instead of position.

Memory Management
-----------------
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 10 10 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property Name
     - Type
     - Default Value
     - Description
   * - max_partial_aggregation_memory
     - integer
     - 16MB
     - Maximum amount of memory in bytes for partial aggregation results. Increasing this value can result in less
       network transfer and lower CPU utilization by allowing more groups to be kept locally before being flushed,
       at the cost of additional memory usage.
   * - max_extended_partial_aggregation_memory
     - integer
     - 16MB
     - Maximum amount of memory in bytes for partial aggregation results if cardinality reduction is below
       `partial_aggregation_reduction_ratio_threshold`. Every time partial aggregate results size reaches
       `max_partial_aggregation_memory` bytes, the results are flushed. If cardinality reduction is below
       `partial_aggregation_reduction_ratio_threshold`,
       i.e. `number of result rows / number of input rows > partial_aggregation_reduction_ratio_threshold`,
       memory limit for partial aggregation is automatically doubled up to `max_extended_partial_aggregation_memory`.
       This adaptation is disabled by default, since the value of `max_extended_partial_aggregation_memory` equals the
       value of `max_partial_aggregation_memory`. Specify higher value for `max_extended_partial_aggregation_memory` to enable.

Spilling
--------
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 10 10 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property Name
     - Type
     - Default Value
     - Description
   * - spill_enabled
     - boolean
     - false
     - Spill memory to disk to avoid exceeding memory limits for the query.
   * - aggregation_spill_enabled
     - boolean
     - true
     - When `spill_enabled` is true, determines whether HashAggregation operator can spill to disk under memory pressure.
   * - join_spill_enabled
     - boolean
     - true
     - When `spill_enabled` is true, determines whether HashBuild and HashProbe operators can spill to disk under memory pressure.
   * - order_by_spill_enabled
     - boolean
     - true
     - When `spill_enabled` is true, determines whether OrderBy operator can spill to disk under memory pressure.
   * - window_spill_enabled
     - boolean
     - true
     - When `spill_enabled` is true, determines whether Window operator can spill to disk under memory pressure.
   * - row_number_spill_enabled
     - boolean
     - true
     - When `spill_enabled` is true, determines whether RowNumber operator can spill to disk under memory pressure.
   * - topn_row_number_spill_enabled
     - boolean
     - true
     - When `spill_enabled` is true, determines whether TopNRowNumber operator can spill to disk under memory pressure.
   * - writer_spill_enabled
     - boolean
     - true
     - When `writer_spill_enabled` is true, determines whether TableWriter operator can flush the buffered data to disk
       under memory pressure.
   * - aggregation_spill_memory_threshold
     - integer
     - 0
     - Maximum amount of memory in bytes that a final aggregation can use before spilling. 0 means unlimited.
   * - join_spill_memory_threshold
     - integer
     - 0
     - Maximum amount of memory in bytes that a hash join build side can use before spilling. 0 means unlimited.
   * - order_by_spill_memory_threshold
     - integer
     - 0
     - Maximum amount of memory in bytes that an order by can use before spilling. 0 means unlimited.
   * - writer_flush_threshold_bytes
     - integer
     - 96MB
     - Minimum memory footprint size required to reclaim memory from a file writer by flushing its buffered data to disk.
   * - min_spillable_reservation_pct
     - integer
     - 5
     - The minimal available spillable memory reservation in percentage of the current memory usage. Suppose the current
       memory usage size of M, available memory reservation size of N and min reservation percentage of P,
       if M * P / 100 > N, then spiller operator needs to grow the memory reservation with percentage of
       'spillable_reservation_growth_pct' (see below). This ensures we have sufficient amount of memory reservation to
       process the large input outlier.
   * - spillable_reservation_growth_pct
     - integer
     - 10
     - The spillable memory reservation growth percentage of the current memory usage. Suppose a growth percentage of N
       and the current memory usage size of M, the next memory reservation size will be M * (1 + N / 100). After growing
       the memory reservation K times, the memory reservation size will be M * (1 + N / 100) ^ K. Hence the memory
       reservation grows along a series of powers of (1 + N / 100). If the memory reservation fails, it starts spilling.
   * - max_spill_level
     - integer
     - 4
     - The maximum allowed spilling level with zero being the initial spilling level. Applies to hash join build
       spilling which might use recursive spilling when the build table is very large. -1 means unlimited.
       In this case an extremely large query might run out of spilling partition bits. The max spill level
       can be used to prevent a query from using too much io and cpu resources.
   * - max_spill_run_rows
     - integer
     - 12582912
     - The max number of rows to fill and spill for each spill run. This is used to cap the memory used for spilling.
       If it is zero, then there is no limit and spilling might run out of memory. Based on offline test results, the
       default value is set to 12 million rows which uses ~128MB memory when to fill a spill run.
       Relation between spill rows and memory usage are as follows:
         * ``12 million rows: 128 MB``
         * ``30 million rows: 256 MB``
         * ``60 million rows: 512 MB``
   * - max_spill_file_size
     - integer
     - 0
     - The maximum allowed spill file size. Zero means unlimited.
   * - max_spill_bytes
     - integer
     - 107374182400
     - The max spill bytes limit set for each query. This is used to cap the storage used for spilling.
       If it is zero, then there is no limit and spilling might exhaust the storage or takes too long to run.
       The default value is set to 100 GB.
   * - spill_write_buffer_size
     - integer
     - 4MB
     - The maximum size in bytes to buffer the serialized spill data before write to disk for IO efficiency.
       If set to zero, buffering is disabled.
   * - min_spill_run_size
     - integer
     - 256MB
     - The minimum spill run size (bytes) limit used to select partitions for spilling. The spiller tries to spill a
       previously spilled partitions if its data size exceeds this limit, otherwise it spills the partition with most data.
       If the limit is zero, then the spiller always spills a previously spilled partition if it has any data. This is
       to avoid spill from a partition with a small amount of data which might result in generating too many small
       spilled files.
   * - spill_compression_codec
     - string
     - none
     - Specifies the compression algorithm type to compress the spilled data before write to disk to trade CPU for IO
       efficiency. The supported compression codecs are: ZLIB, SNAPPY, LZO, ZSTD, LZ4 and GZIP.
       NONE means no compression.
   * - spiller_start_partition_bit
     - integer
     - 29
     - The start partition bit which is used with `spiller_partition_bits` together to calculate the spilling partition number.
   * - spiller_num_partition_bits
     - integer
     - 3
     - The number of bits (N) used to calculate the spilling partition number for hash join and RowNumber: 2 ^ N. At the moment the maximum
       value is 3, meaning we only support up to 8-way spill partitioning.ing.
   * - testing.spill_pct
     - integer
     - 0
     - Percentage of aggregation or join input batches that will be forced to spill for testing. 0 means no extra spilling.
