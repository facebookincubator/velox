Plan Nodes and Operators
========================

Velox query plan is a tree of PlanNode's. Each PlanNode has zero or more child
PlanNode's. To execute a query plan, Velox converts it into a set of pipelines.
Each pipeline is made of a linear sequence of operators that corresponds to a
linear sub-tree of the plan. The plan tree is broken down into a set of linear
sub-trees by disconnecting all but one child node from each node that has two
or more children.

The conversion of plan nodes to operators is mostly one-to-one. Some exceptions are:

* Filter node followed by Project node is converted into a single operator FilterProject
* Nodes with two or more child nodes are converted to multiple operators, e.g. HashJoin node is converted to a pair of operators: HashProbe and HashBuild.

Operators corresponding to leaf nodes are called source operators. Only a subset
of plan nodes can be located at the leaves of the plan tree. These are:

* TableScanNode
* ValuesNode
* ExchangeNode
* MergeExchangeNode
* ArrowStreamNode

Here is a list of supported plan nodes and corresponding operators.

Plan Nodes
----------

TableScanNode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The table scan operation reads data from a connector. For example, when used
with HiveConnector, table scan reads data from ORC or Parquet files.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 30
   :align: left
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description
   * - outputType
     - A list of output columns. This is a subset of columns available in the underlying table. The order of columns may not match the schema of the table.

FilterNode
~~~~~~~~~~

The filter operation eliminates one or more records from the input data based
on a boolean filter expression.

.. list-table::

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description
   * - filter

   * - aggregates
     - Expressions for computing the measures, e.g. count(1), sum(a), avg(b). Expressions must be in the form of aggregate function calls over input columns directly, e.g. sum(c) is ok, but sum(c + d) is not.

     - For each measure, an optional boolean input column that is used to mask out rows for this particular measure.
   * - ignoreNullKeys
     - A boolean flag indicating whether the aggregation should drop rows with nulls in any of the grouping keys. Used to avoid unnecessary processing for an aggregation followed by an inner join on the grouping keys.

.. _group-id-node:

implement aggregations over grouping sets.

HashJoinNode and MergeJoinNode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The join operation combines two separate inputs into a single output, based on a
join expression. A common subtype of joins is an equality join where the join
expression is constrained to a list of equality (or equality + null equality)
conditions between the two inputs of the join.

HashJoinNode represents an implementation that starts by loading all rows from
the right side of the join into a hash table, then streams left side of the
join probing the hash table for matching rows and emitting results.

MergeJoinNode represents an implementation that assumes that both inputs are
sorted on the join keys and streams both join sides looking for matching rows
and emitting results.

.. list-table::

   :align: left
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - rightKeys
     - Columns from the right hand side input that are part of the equality condition. At least one must be specified. The number and order of the rightKeys must match the number and order of the leftKeys.
   * - filter
     - Optional non-equality filter expression that may reference columns from both inputs.
   * - outputType
     - A list of output columns. This is a subset of columns available in the left and right inputs of the join. The columns may appear in different order than in the input.

CrossJoinNode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cross join operation combines two separate inputs into a single output by
combining each row of the left hand side input with each row of the right hand
side input. If there are N rows in the left input and M rows in the right
input, the output of the cross join will contain N * M rows.

TopNNode
~~~~~~~~

The top-n operation reorders a dataset based on one or more identified sort
fields as well as a sorting order. Rather than sort the entire dataset, the
top-n will only maintain the total number of records required to ensure a
limited output. A top-n is a combination of a logical sort and logical limit
operations.

expanded into a single column, and maps are expanded into two columns
(key, value). Can be used to expand multiple columns. In this case produces as
many rows as the highest cardinality array or map (the other columns are padded
with nulls). Optionally can produce an ordinality column that specifies the row
number starting with 1.

TableWriteNode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

connector. An example would be writing ORC or Parquet files. The table write
operation return a single row with a single column containing the number of
rows written to storage.

values set to null. If input contains more than one row raises an exception.

Used for queries with non-correlated sub-queries.

AssignUniqueIdNode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The assign unique id operation adds one column at the end of the input columns
with unique value per row. This unique value marks each output row to be unique
among all output rows of this operator.

The 64-bit unique id is built in following way:
- first 24 bits - task unique id
- next 40 bits - operator counter value

The task unique id is added to ensure the generated id is unique across all
the nodes executing the same query stage in a distributed query execution.

WindowNode
~~~~~~~~~~

The Window operator is used to evaluate window functions. The operator adds columns
for the window functions output at the end of the input columns.

The window operator groups the input data into partitions based on the values
of the partition columns. If no partition columns are specified, then all the input
rows are considered to be in the same partition.
Within each partition rows are ordered by the values of the sorting columns.
The window function is computed for each row at a time in this order.
If no sorting columns are specified then the order of the results is unspecified.

  * - windowFunctions
    - Window function calls with the frame clause. e.g row_number(), first_value(name) between range 10 preceding and current row. The default frame is between range unbounded preceding and current row.

Examples
--------

Join
~~~~

A query plan with a join includes a HashJoinNode. Such a plan is translated into
two pipelines: build and probe. Build pipeline is processing input from the
build side of the join and uses HashBuild operator to build a hash table. Probe
pipeline is processing input from the probe side of the join, probes the hash
table and produces rows that match join criteria. Build pipeline provides the
hash table to the probe pipeline via a special mechanism called JoinBridge.
JoinBridge is like a future, where HashBuild operator completes the future with
a HashTable as a result and HashProbe operator receives the HashTable when
future completes.

Each pipeline can run with different levels of parallelism. In the example
below, the probe pipeline runs on 2 threads, while the build pipeline runs on 3
threads. When the build pipeline runs multi-threaded, each pipeline processes a
portion of the build-side input. The last pipeline to finish processing is
responsible for combining the hash tables from the other pipelines and
publishing the final table to the JoinBridge. When the probe pipeline for the
right outer join runs multi-threaded, the last pipeline to finish processing is
responsible for emitting rows from the build side that didn’t match the join
condition.

Local Exchange
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A local exchange operation has multiple uses. It is used to change the
parallelism of the data processing from multi-threaded to single-threaded or
vice versa. For example, local exchange can be used in a sort operation where
partial sort runs multi-threaded and then results are merged on a single
thread. Local exchange operation is also used to combine results of multiple
pipelines. For example to combine multiple inputs of the UNION or UNION ALL.

Here are some examples.

N-to-1 local exchange that could be used for combining partially sorted results
for final merge sort.

.. image:: images/local-exchange-N-to-1.png
