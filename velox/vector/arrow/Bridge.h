///
///   https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface.html

/// The output ArrowArray needs to be allocated by the consumer (either in the

/// the release() function (or memory will leak).
///
/// After exporting, the ArrowArray will hold ownership to the underlying Vector
/// being referenced, so the consumer does not need to explicitly hold on to the
/// input Vector shared_ptr.
///
/// The function takes a memory pool where allocations will be made (in cases
/// where the conversion is not zero-copy, e.g. for strings) and throws in case
/// the conversion is not implemented yet.
///
/// Example usage:
///
///   ArrowArray arrowArray;
///   arrow::exportToArrow(inputVector, arrowArray);
///   inputVector.reset(); // don't need to hold on to this shared_ptr.
///
///   (use arrowArray)

/// the client is free to release any buffers associated with the input
/// ArrowSchema object.
///
/// The function throws in case there was no valid conversion available.
///
/// Example usage:
///
///   ArrowSchema arrowSchema;
///   ... // fills arrowSchema
///   auto type = arrow::importToArrow(arrowSchema);
///
///   arrowSchema.release(&arrowSchema);
///

/// This function takes both an ArrowArray (which contains the buffers) and an
/// ArrowSchema (which describes the data type), since a Velox vector needs
/// both (buffer and type). A memory pool is also required, since all vectors
/// carry a pointer to it, but not really used in most cases - unless the
/// conversion itself requires a new allocation. In most cases no new
/// allocations are required, unless for arrays of varchars (or varbinaries) and
/// complex types written out of order.
///
/// The new Velox vector returned contains only references to the underlying
/// buffers, so it's the client's responsibility to ensure the buffer's
/// lifetime.
///
/// The function throws in case the conversion fails.
///
/// Example usage:
///
///   ArrowSchema arrowSchema;
///   ArrowArray arrowArray;
///   ... // fills structures
///   auto vector = arrow::importToArrow(arrowSchema, arrowArray, pool);
///   ... // ensure buffers in arrowArray remain alive while vector is used.
