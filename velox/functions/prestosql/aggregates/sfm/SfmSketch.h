/// SFM sketch is used for estimating distinct count, very similar to
/// HyperLogLog. This sketch is introduced in the paper Sketch-Flip-Merge:
/// Mergeable Sketches for Private Distinct Counting
/// <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02056.pdf>.

/// The primary differences between SFM sketch and HyperLogLog are that
///  (a) SFM sketch supports noise addition.
///  (b) SFM sketch tracks a larger number of hash statistics (and is therefore
///  larger).

/// The SFM sketch data structure is initially created without noise.
/// Noise is added by randomizing the bits of the sketch via the
/// enablePrivacy() function. Once noise has been added, further items
/// cannot be added to the sketch. However, two or more noisy sketches may be
/// merged together. A typical work flow is: initialize -> add -> merge/
/// enablePrivacy -> cardinality.

/// The noise level is quantified by the parameter 'epsilon', a positive real
/// number. A smaller value of 'epsilon' corresponds to a more noisy sketch.
/// An 'epsilon' of 0 would yield a summary that is entirely noise, while an
/// 'epsilon' that is infinite yields no noise. The estimated cardinality
/// becomes less accurate with the addition of more noise (i.e., smaller
/// 'epsilon' yield less accurate results. bits of the sketch are randomized
/// with probability 1 / (1 + exp(epsilon)), an epsilon of 1 will flip about
/// 1 / (1 + exp(1)) = 27% of the bits of the sketch).
