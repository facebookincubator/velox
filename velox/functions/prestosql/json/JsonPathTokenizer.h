///
///   $ - the root element
///   . or [] - child operator
///   * - wildcard (all objects/elements regardless their names)
///
/// Supports single- and double-quoted keys.
///
/// Notably, doesn't support deep scan, e.g. $..author.
///
/// The leading '$.' is optional. Paths '$.foo.bar' and 'foo.bar' are
/// equivalent. This is not part of JSONPath syntax, but this is the behavior of
/// Jayway implementation used by Presto.
///
/// The leading '$' is optional in paths like '$[0]' or '$["foo"]'. Paths '[0]'
/// and '$[0]' are equivalent.  This is not part of JSONPath syntax, but this is
/// the behavior of Jayway implementation used by Presto.
///
/// It is allowed to use dot-notation redundantly, e.g. non-standard path
/// '$.[0].foo' is allowed and is equivalent to '$[0].foo'. Similarly, paths
/// '$.[0].[1].[2]' and '$[0].[1][2]' are allowed and equivalent to
/// '$[0][1][2]'.
///
/// Examples:
///   "$"
///   "$.store.book[0].author"
///   "store.book[0].author"
///   "store.book.[0].author"
///   "$[0].foo.bar"
///   "$[-1]"
