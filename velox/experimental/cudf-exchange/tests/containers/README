This tests does a simple exchange using the one billion
row challenge example, which is implemented as 2 Velox tasks
that communicate via the CudfExchange/UCXX:

- the 1brc_server reads a parquet file containing the challenge data
- the 1brc_client does the actual processing

First create the image:

$ cd velox/experimental/cudf-exchange/tests/containers
$ ./create_docker.sh

Then start the image this will be called  `velox-dev-ucx-test`
You will need to have a large one billion row challenge  parquet file and
change the mount volume in the following script to use this:

./start_docker.sh


Start the 1brc_server by logging it to container from a terminal:

$ docker exec -it velox-dev-ucx-test /bin/bash
$$ cd velox/experimental/cudf-exchange/tests/scripts
$$ ./1brc_server.sh

Start the 1brc_client in the same way:

$ docker exec -it velox-dev-ucx-test /bin/bash
$$ cd velox/experimental/cudf-exchange/tests/scripts
$$ ./1brc_server.sh

The scripts can be changed to use different UCX configurations,
for example changing the memory from async to pool bt
setting `-velox_cudf_memory_resource=pool`

IMPORTANT one can set whatever port one wants at the server,
BUT the nodes defined at the client MUST  be that
port+3, this is an artifact of Velox
