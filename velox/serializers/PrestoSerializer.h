/// There are two ways to serialize data using PrestoVectorSerde:
///
/// 1. In order to append multiple RowVectors into the same serialized payload,
/// one can first create a VectorSerializer using createSerializer(), then
/// append successive RowVectors using VectorSerializer::append(). In this case,
/// since different RowVector might encode columns differently, data is always
/// flattened in the serialized payload.
///
/// Note that there are two flavors of append(), one that takes a range of rows,
/// and one that takes a list of row ids. The former is useful when serializing
/// large sections of the input vector (or the full vector); the latter is
/// efficient for a selective subset, e.g. when splitting a vector to a large
/// number of output shuffle destinations.
///
/// 2. To serialize a single RowVector, one can use the serializeEncoded()
/// method. Since it serializes a single RowVector, it tries to preserve the
/// encodings of the input data. Check the method documentation below to learn
/// about the cases in which encodings are preserved.
