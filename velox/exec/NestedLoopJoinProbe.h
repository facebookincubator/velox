/// Implements a Nested Loop Join (NLJ) between records from the probe (input_)
/// and build (NestedLoopJoinBridge) sides. It supports inner, left, right and
/// full outer joins.
///
/// This class is generally useful to evaluate non-equi-joins (e.g. "k1 >= k2"),
/// when join conditions may need to be evaluated against a full cross product
/// of the input. It can also implement cross-join semantics if joinCondition is
/// nullptr.
///
/// The output follows the order of the probe side rows (for inner and left
/// joins). All build vectors are materialized upfront (check buildVectors_),
/// but probe batches are processed one-by-one as a stream.
///
/// To produce output, the operator processes each probe record from probe
/// input, using the following steps:
///
/// 1. Materialize a cross-product batch across probe and build.
/// 2. Evaluate the join condition.
/// 3. Add key matches to the output.
/// 4. Once all build vectors are processed for a particular probe row, check if
///    a probe mismatch is needed (only for left and full outer joins).
/// 5. Once all probe and build inputs are processed, check if build mismatches
///    are needed (only for right and full outer joins).
/// 6. If so, signal other peer operators; only a single operator instance will
///    collect all build matches at the end, and emit any records that haven't
///    been matched by any of the peers.
///
/// There are three different cases for the generation of cross-product across
/// probe and build (#1 above):
///
/// a) If build side has a single row, simply wrap that row as a constant and
/// produce it along with probe batches.
///
/// b) If build side has a single batch, produce a dictionary wrapped across
/// probe and build rows, covering as many probe rows as allowed by
/// `outputBatchSize_` (maximum record to produce per batch).
///
/// c) If build side has multiple vectors, take one probe row are at a time,
/// wrapping it as a constant, and produce it along with build batches.
///
/// If needed, buid-side copies are done lazily; it first accumulates the ranges
/// to be copied, then performs the copies in batch, column-by-column. It
/// produces at most `outputBatchSize_` records, but it may produce fewer since
/// the output needs to follow the probe vector boundaries.
