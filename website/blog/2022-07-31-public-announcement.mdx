We are extremely excited to introduce Velox as an [open-source project](https://engineering.fb.com/2023/03/09/open-source/velox-open-source-execution-engine/), with a mission to define common standards for modular data processing systems. Velox provides reusable, extensible, high-performance, and dialect-agnostic data processing components for building execution engines, and enhancing data management systems. We envision Velox to be the defacto execution engine for [Arrow-compatible](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/06/23/2468271/0/en/Voltron-Data-Announces-Commitment-to-Improve-Interoperability-Between-Apache-Arrow-and-the-Velox-Open-Source-Project-Created-by-Meta.html) data format powering ML and Analytical workloads.

The Velox team has been partnering with companies such as [Ahana, Intel, and Voltron Data](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/news/252524446/Meta-and-partners-build-Velox-open-source-execution-engine?amp=1) as well as various academic institutions to accelerate innovation and development in the data management industry.

Looking at the future, we believe Velox’s unified and modular nature has the potential to disrupt the data management industry. It will allow us to deepen our partnership with hardware vendors and proactively adapt our unified software stack as hardware advances. We believe that modularity and reusability are the future of database system development and hope a vibrant open source community will help us in this journey.
