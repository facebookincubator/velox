# The CODEOWNERS file allows us to setup file based rules that will automatically
# request a review from owners on PRs with changes to matching files.
# We currently do not enforce these reviews as required so it's only a tool
# for more granular notifications at the moment. For example component maintainers
# can set a rule so that they are pinged on changes to the sections of the 
# codebase that are relevant for their component.

# Only users that have write access to the repo can be added as owners.
# See the official docs for more details on syntax and precedence of rules: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners#example-of-a-codeowners-file
